This is my cloned readme to learn ho to write my own readme file in the future.
Let me show you how to install and run Betty linter for your C programming.

# Betty

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holbertonschool/Betty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/holbertonschool/Betty)

### Installation

Run the script `install.sh` with **sudo privileges** to install `Betty-style` and `betty-doc` on your computer, along with the following manuals:

* _betty(1)_
* _betty-style(1)_
* _betty-doc(1)_


### Documentation

Please visit the [Betty Wiki](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) for the full specifications of Betty coding and documentation styles.

You'll also find some references and some tools for common text editors such as Emacs and Atom.

### Usage

Run the following command to check if your code/doc fits the Betty Style (mostly inspired from the Linux Kernel style):

```ShellSession
betty-style file1 [file2 [file3 [...]]]
```

```ShellSession
betty-doc file1 [file2 [file3 [...]]]
